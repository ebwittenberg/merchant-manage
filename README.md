# Merchant Management Platform

#### Description
This app is designed for merchants with purchase orders coming in from their sales team. They have a list of inventory, and need to submit the PO into the system. Once submitted, the merchant will be able to see the tracking status of the shipment, and the new stock of that item after the purchase quantity has been subtracted.

#### Features
* Merchant can enter a purchase order into the system nd the app will match it to the correct item in their list of inventory
* The current stock for that item will recalculate after the PO has been submitted, showing the new stock level
* The merchant can then see that a new shipment has been added with a tracking number and shipment status (pending fulfillment, shipped, delivered, etc...)
